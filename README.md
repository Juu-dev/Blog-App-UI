# Blog app with Reactjs

This project is not my idea.

I learned from a pro dev who named **Lama dev**.

This is his youtube channel: (https://www.youtube.com/c/LamaDev)

## Several convention about how to folder/file named
 - Folder:
   - Folder named by camelcase contain directly file .js and .scss. This folder has the same name as the file inside.
   - Folder named by lowercase is only contained folder
 - File :
   - File .js and .scss in same folder must same name. They combine to form component of Blog
